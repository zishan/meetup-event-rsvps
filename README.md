## STEP 1: API KEY
Get your [API KEY](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/) on Meetup API.
 
## STEP 2: Event ID
To retrieve RSVPs for a particular event, you'll need the event id.

Generally, you can visit the event itself and look for "meetup.com/[group name]/events/[event id]" in the URL.

## STEP 3: Modify ruby-example.rb
1. set `api_key=` with your application key from step 1
2. populate `event_id=` with your event id from step 3
3. run the script

You are now free to move about the cabin.
